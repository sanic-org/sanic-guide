# Version 23.3

[[toc]]

## Introduction

This is the first release of the version 23 [release cycle](../../org/policies.md#release-schedule). As such contains some deprecations and hopefully some *small* breaking changes. If you run into any issues, please raise a concern on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/new/choose).

## What to know

More details in the [Changelog](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sanic/changelog.html). Notable new or breaking features, and what to upgrade...

### Nicer traceback formatting

The SCO adopted two projects into the Sanic namespace on GitHub: [tracerite](https://github.com/sanic-org/tracerite) and [html5tagger](https://github.com/sanic-org/html5tagger). These projects team up to provide and incredible new error page with more details to help the debugging process.

This is provided out of the box, and will adjust to display only relevant information whether in DEBUG more or PROD mode.

:---

Light and dark mode HTML pages are available and will be used implicitly.

### Basic file browser on directories

When serving a directory from a static handler, Sanic can be configured to show a basic file browser instead using `directory_view=True`.

---:1
```python
app.static("/uploads/", "/path/to/dir/", directory_view=True)
```
:--:

:---


Light and dark mode HTML pages are available and will be used implicitly.

### HTML templating with Python

Because Sanic is using [html5tagger](https://github.com/sanic-org/html5tagger) under the hood to render the [new error pages](#nicer-traceback-formatting), you now have the package available to you to easily generate HTML pages in Python code:


---:1
```python
from html5tagger import Document, E
from sanic import Request, Sanic, html

app = Sanic("TestApp")


@app.get("/")
async def handler(request: Request):
    doc = Document("My Website")
    doc.h1("Hello, world.")
    with doc.table(id="data"):
        doc.tr.th("First").th("Second").th("Third")
        doc.tr.td(1).td(2).td(3)
    doc.p(
        "A paragraph with ",
        E.a("a link", href="/files"),
        " and ",
        class_="text",
    ).em("formatting")
    return html(doc)
```
:--:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>My Website</title>
<h1>Hello, world.</h1>
<table id=data>
    <tr>
        <th>First
        <th>Second
        <th>Third
    <tr>
        <td>1
        <td>2
        <td>3
</table>
<p class=text>
    A paragraph with <a href="/files">a link</a> and <em>formatting</em>
```
:---

### Auto-index serving is available on static handlers

Sanic can now be configured to serve an index file when serving a static directory.

```python
app.static("/assets/", "/path/to/some/dir", index="index.html")
```

When using the above, requests to `http://example.com/assets/` will automatically serve the `index.html` file located in that directory.

### Simpler CLI targets

The CLI application target (the second value of the `sanic` CLI command) now tries to infer the run type based upon what the target is.

As normal, providing a path to a module and an application instance will work as expected.

```sh
sanic path.to.module:app          # global app instance
```

Previously, to serve the factory pattern, you would need to use the `--factory` flag. This can be omitted now.

```sh
sanic path.to.module:create_app   # factory pattern
```

Similarly, to launch the Sanic simple server (serve static directory), you would need to use the `--simple` flag. This can be omitted now.

```sh
sanic ./path/to/directory/        # simple serve
```

### More convenient methods for setting and deleting cookies

The old cookie pattern was awkward and clunky. It didn't look like regular Python because of the "magic" going on under the hood.

---:1
ðŸ˜± This is not intuitive and is confusing for newcomers.
:--:
```python
response = text("There's a cookie up in this response")
response.cookies["test"] = "It worked!"
response.cookies["test"]["domain"] = ".yummy-yummy-cookie.com"
response.cookies["test"]["httponly"] = True
```
:---

There are now new methods (and completely overhauled `Cookie` and `CookieJar` objects) to make this process more convenient.

---:1
ðŸ˜Œ Ahh... Much nicer.
:--:
```python
response = text("There's a cookie up in this response")
response.add_cookie(
    "test",
    "It worked!",
    domain=".yummy-yummy-cookie.com",
    httponly=True
)
```
:---

### Better cookie compatibility

Sanic has added support for [cookie prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#cookie_prefixes), making it seemless and easy to read and write cookies with the values.

While setting the cookie...

```py
response.cookies.add_cookie("foo", "bar", host_prefix=True)
```

This will create the prefixed cookie: `__Host-foo`. However, when accessing the cookie on an incoming request, you can do so without knowing about the existence of the header.

```py
request.cookies.get("foo")
```

It should also be noted, cookies can be accessed as properties just like [headers](#access-any-header-as-a-property).

```python
request.cookies.foo
```

And, cookies are similar to the `request.args` and `request.form` objects in that multiple values can be retrieved using `getlist`.

```py
request.cookies.getlist("foo")
```

Also added is support for creating [partitioned cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#partitioned_cookie).

```py
response.cookies.add_cookie(. . ., partitioned=True)
```

### ðŸš¨ *BREAKING CHANGE* - More consistent and powerful `SanicException`

Sanic has for a while included the `SanicException` as a base class exception. This could be extended to add `status_code`, etc. [See more details](http://localhost:8080/en/guide/best-practices/exceptions.html).

**NOW**, using all of the various exceptions has become easier. The commonly used exceptions can be imported directly from the root level module.

```python
from sanic import NotFound, Unauthorized, BadRequest, ServerError
```

In addition, all of these arguments are available as keyword arguments on every exception type:

| argument | type | description |
|--|--|--|
| `quiet` | `bool` | Suppress the traceback from the logs |
| `context` | `dict` | Additional information *NOT* sent to the client |
| `extra` | `dict` | Additional information that is sent to the client |
| `headers` | `dict` | Additional headers sent in the response |

None of these are themselves new features. However, they are more consistent in how you can use them, thus creating a powerful way to control error responses directly.

```py
raise ServerError(headers={"foo": "bar"})
```

The part of this that is a breaking change is that some formerly positional arguments are now keyword only.

You are encouraged to look at the specific implementations for each error in the [API documents](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sanic/api/exceptions.html#module-sanic.exceptions).

### ðŸš¨ *BREAKING CHANGE* - Refresh `Request.accept` functionality to be more performant and spec-compliant

Parsing od the `Accept` headers into the `Request.accept` accessor has been improved. If you were using this property and relying upon its equality operation, this has changed. You should probably transition to using the `request.accept.match()` method.

### Access any header as a property

To simplify access to headers, you can access a raw (unparsed) version of the header as a property. The name of the header is the name of the property in all lowercase letters, and switching any hyphens (`-`) to underscores (`_`).

For example:

---:1
```
GET /foo/bar HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
X-Request-ID: 123ABC
```
:--:
```py
request.headers.host
request.headers.user_agent
request.headers.x_request_id
```
:---

### Consume `DELETE` body by default

By default, the body of a `DELETE` request will now be consumed and read onto the `Request` object. This will make `body` available  like on `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests without any further action.

### Custom `CertLoader` for direct control of creating `SSLContext`

Sometimes you may want to create your own `SSLContext` object. To do this, you can create your own subclass of `CertLoader` that will generate your desired context object.

```python
from sanic.worker.loader import CertLoader


class MyCertLoader(CertLoader):
    def load(self, app: Sanic) -> SSLContext:
        . . .


app = Sanic(. . ., certloader_class=MyCertLoader)
```
