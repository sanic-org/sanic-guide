# Development

The first thing that should be mentioned is that the webserver that is integrated into Sanic is **not** just a development server. 

It is production ready out-of-the-box, *unless you enable in debug mode*.

## Debug mode

By setting the debug mode, Sanic will be more verbose in its output and will disable several run-time optimizations.

```python
# server.py
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json

app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/")
async def hello_world(request):
    return json({"hello": "world"})
```
```sh
sanic server:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=1234 --debug
```

::: warning
Sanic's debug mode will slow down the server's performance and is therefore advised to enable it only in development environments.

## Automatic Reloader

---:1

Sanic offers a way to enable or disable the Automatic Reloader. The easiest way to enable it is using the CLI's `--reload` argument to activate the Automatic Reloader. Every time a Python file is changed, the reloader will restart your application automatically. This is very convenient while developing.

*NOTE: The reloader is only available when using Sanic's [worker manager](./manager.md). If you have disabled it using `--single-process` then the reloader will not be available to you.*
:--:1
```sh
sanic path.to:app --reload
```
You can also use the shorthand property
```sh
sanic path.to:app -r
```
:---

---:1
If you have additional directories that you would like to automatically reload on file save (for example, a directory of HTML templates), you can add that using `--reload-dir`.
:--:1
```sh
sanic path.to:app --reload --reload-dir=/path/to/templates
```
Or multiple directories, shown here using the shorthand properties
```sh
sanic path.to:app -r -R /path/to/one -R /path/to/two
```
:---

## Best of both worlds
---:1
If you would like to be in debug mode **and** have the Automatic Reloader running, you can pass `dev=True`. This is equivalent to **debug + auto reload**.

*Added in v22.3*
:--:1
```sh
sanic path.to:app --dev
```
You can also use the shorthand property
```sh
sanic path.to:app -d
```

## Automatic TLS certificate

When running in `DEBUG` mode, you can ask Sanic to handle setting up localhost temporary TLS certificates. This is helpful if you want to access your local development environment with `https://`.

This functionality is provided by either [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or [trustme](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme). Both are good choices, but there are some differences. `trustme` is a Python library and can be installed into your environment with `pip`. This makes for easy envrionment handling, but it is not compatible when running a HTTP/3 server. `mkcert` might be a more involved installation process, but can install a local CA and make it easier to use.

---:1
You can choose which platform to use by setting `config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR`. When set to `"auto"`, it will select either option, preferring `mkcert` if possible.
:--:1
```python
app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "auto"
app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "mkcert"
app.config.LOCAL_CERT_CREATOR = "trustme"
```
:---


---:1
Automatic TLS can be enabled at Sanic server run time:
:--:1
```sh
sanic path.to.server:app --auto-tls --debug
```
:---

::: warning

Localhost TLS certificates (like those generated by both `mkcert` and `trustme`) are **NOT** suitable for production environments. If you are not familiar with how to obtain a *real* TLS certificate, checkout the [How to...](../how-to/tls.md) section.
